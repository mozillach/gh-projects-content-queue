- Auto create posts for new discourse threads
- Auto create posts for posts in an Atom or RSS feed

    - Supports replying, reposts and spoilers

### Planned

- Tweet pinning management (will probably happen for Mastodon first, since there's actually an API for that there)
- See all the issues with the enhancement tag...

## Set up a repo for use with this tool

### Requirements

- GitHub user auth token (will use that to create issues and comment on them etc.)
    - Log in with your GitHub user
    - Go to your settings
    - Go to "Personal access token" and go click on the "Generate new token" button
    - Select the "public_repo" scope and if you are using it with an organization "read:org" and click save
    - Add the resulting token to the `config.json` file (`accounts.github.token` property)
- Twitter API credentials incl. OAuth tokens and secret (will tweet to this account)
    - Create a new App through [developer.twitter.com/apps](https://developer.twitter.com/apps)
    - Apply for a developer account if you don't have one yet
    - There is no need to define a redirect URL, just leave the field blank
    - Copy the consumer key and secret to the fields in the `config.json` file
    - Click on "Create access token"
    - Copy the access token key and secret to the fields in the `config.json` file
- Mastodon OAuth access token (will toot to this account)
    - In the following, replace `https://mastodoninstance.example.com` with the URL of your instance
    - Create a new application at `https://mastodoninstance.example.com/settings/applications/new`
    - Grant all read and write scopes. In theory the `read:accounts`, `read:statuses` and `write:statuses` should be enough at the moment, but this is untested
    - Go to the application and copy the access token under "Your access token"
    - The instance URL is probably `https://mastodoninstance.example.com/api/v1`
    - Add both the access token and the instance URL to the fields in the `config.json` file
- Node >= 8.0.0
